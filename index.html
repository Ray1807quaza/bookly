        <h2>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn By Mark Twain</h2>
        <img src="bookCover/1.png"  class="books">
        <P> Adventures of Huckleberry Finn or as it is known in more recent editions, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, is a novel by American author Mark Twain, which was first published in the United Kingdom in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885.

            Commonly named among the Great American Novels, the work is among the first in major American literature to be written throughout in vernacular English, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the first person by Huckleberry "Huck" Finn, the narrator of two other Twain novels (Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective) and a friend of Tom Sawyer. It is a direct sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

            The book is noted for "changing the course of children's literature" in the United States for the "deeply felt portrayal of boyhood".It is also known for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River. Set in a Southern antebellum society that had ceased to exist over 20 years before the work was published, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an often scathing satire on entrenched attitudes, particularly racism.

            Perennially popular with readers, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has also been the continued object of study by literary critics since its publication. The book was widely criticized upon release because of its extensive use of coarse language. Throughout the 20th century, and despite arguments that the protagonist and the tenor of the book are anti-racist, criticism of the book continued due to both its perceived use of racial stereotypes and its frequent use of the racial slur "nigger".

        <h2>Kidnapped By Robert Louis Stevenson</h2>
        <img src="bookCover/2.png"  class="books">
        <P> What if someday you come to know that you own a property worth billions but that is in the possession of your relative?
            You will certainly rush to claim it and enjoy a luxurious life but remember my friend, claiming your right may cost you your
            life.
            Something similar happened with David Balfour after he turned an orphan. He was thrilled unaware of the fact that this will put
            him in a life threatening situation. What is his ultimate fate lies in this amazing novel named, Kidnapped.</P>
           <p>Kidnapped is one of the famous works of Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson which was originally
            published in 1886. It is a historic adventure and speculative fiction work which was written as a
            boys novel and was published in the Young Folks magazines.
            It was followed by the Catriona (1893) and was adapted to premiere for several years on the big screen from 1917 to 2005.
            A comic version was also published by Marvel Illustrated in 2007-2008. It was believed that the novel was based on the
            James Annesley Case  who was kidnapped by his own uncle at the age of 12.

        <h2>The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling, 1894</h2>
        <img src="bookCover/3.png"  class="books">
        <P> The Jungle Book is far less whimsical (and musical) than Disney's classic animated film,
            and it includes stories with different central characters besides Mowgli, the "mancub" raised by wolves
             and befriended by Baloo the bear. However, in part because of the charming movie, Mowgli's stories
             are probably the best loved and best known pieces in the collection. These wonderful stories, which
             alternate with lyrical poems about the characters, depict a complex and sometimes dangerous natural
              world in which creatures must respect the "ways of the jungle" in order to coexist. Creatures hunt
               and kill each other in suspenseful scenes, but almost all violent acts happen "offscreen." </P>
               <p>In one scene, Mowgli uses his wits to trick an adversary into being killed by a stampeding herd of cattle;
                 the animal's death is not shown, but Mowgli is later described skinning the animal. In general,
                 animals talk about killing others for food. The Jungle Book has been made into a number of film and TV
                  versions, and a sequel to the book, The Second Jungle Book, contains more stories about Mowgli and
                  other jungle creatures.

        <h2>A Tale of Two Cities Charles Dickens, 1859</h2>
        <img src="bookCover/4.png"  class="books">
        <P> A Tale of Two Cities, sets a riveting story of romantic and familial love against the violent drama of the French Revolution.
             The personal and the political are deeply connected, and complicated, and additional historical background regarding the
             French monarchy, feudal system, and French Revolution will help young readers appreciate the novel. It's also worth noting
              that though this is one of Dickens' best-loved works, it is atypical of the author in some ways. A Tale of Two Cities
               has fewer humorous, colorful characters than others of his most-read books (other than the Crunchers), and the plot is
               more grand and far-reaching.

        <h2>Tarzan of the Apes Edgar Rice Burroughs, 1914</h2>
        <img src="bookCover/5.png"  class="books">
        <P> Tarzan of the Apes, the 1912 book by Edgar Rice Burroughs that launched a pop-cultural empire,
            is a thrilling page-turner with a minefield on nearly every one of its 400 pages. Murder and mayhem abound,
            as humans and animals kill each other, as well as members of their own species, with gusto. And there are cannibals.
             Tarzan himself is fond of snaring members of a jungle tribe with a noose, strangling them, and dropping their bodies
              from treetops vengeful soldiers wipe out a village; seafaring scalawags hack and bludgeon one another to death.
               There are also plentiful, outmoded stereotypes, especially regarding gender roles and race. There's more innuendo
                about primeval behavior than actual lurid detail in the Tarzan-Jane romance, which involves numerous rescues
                 but only one scene of intense kissing (it ends quickly and leads to much internal conflict.

        The shaft flew straight; the archer fell forward with a cry, and lay on his face upon the ground, his arrows rattling about him
        from out of his quiver, the gray goose shaft wet with his; heart’s blood. Then, before the others could gather their wits about
        them, Robin Hood was gone into the depths of the greenwood. Some started after him, but not with much heart, for each feared to
        suffer the death of his fellow; so presently they all came and lifted the dead man up and bore him away to Nottingham Town.
        Meanwhile Robin Hood ran through the greenwood. Gone was all the joy and brightness from everything, for his heart was sick within
         him, and it was borne in upon his soul that he had slain a man.

    ‘Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don’t

It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.

    It was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented himself from London for many years.
     Those who were honoured by a better acquaintance with him than the rest, declared that nobody could pretend to have
      ever seen him anywhere else. His sole pastimes were reading the papers and playing whist. He often won at this game,
      which, as a silent one, harmonised with his nature; but his winnings never went into his purse, being reserved as a
       fund for his charities. Mr. Fogg played, not to win, but for the sake of playing. The game was in his eyes a contest,
        a struggle with a difficulty, yet a motionless, unwearying struggle, congenial to his tastes.
        Phileas Fogg was not known to have either wife or children, which may happen to the most honest
        people; either relatives or near friends, which is certainly more unusual. He lived alone in his house
         in Saville Row, whither none penetrated. A single domestic sufficed to serve him. He breakfasted and
          dined at the club, at hours mathematically fixed, in the same room, at the same table, never taking his
          meals with other members, much less bringing a guest with him; and went home at exactly midnight, only
          to retire at once to bed. He never used the cosy chambers which the Reform provides for its favoured members.
          He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row, either in sleeping or making his toilet. When he
          chose to take a walk it was with a regular step in the entrance hall with its mosaic flooring, or in the circular
           gallery with its …

    For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception.
    He was brought up by hand. The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the
    workhouse authorities to the parish authorities. The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities
     whether there was no female then domiciled in ‘the house’ who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and
     nourishment of which he stood in need. The workhouse authorities replied with humility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish
     authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be ‘farmed,’ or, in other words, that he should be dispatched
     to a branch-workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws, rolled about
     the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence of an
     elderly female, who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week.
     Sevenpence-halfpenny’s worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny,
     quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience;
     she knew what was good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself. So, she appropriated
     the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance
     than was originally provided for them. Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great
      experimental philosopher

    Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow
 that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo…
His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.
He sang that song. That was his song.When you wet the bed first it is warm then it gets cold. His mother put on the oilsheet.
 That had the queer smell.
His mother had a nicer smell than his father. She played on the piano the sailor’s hornpipe for him to dance.

<p>
    I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly very little.
    One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if WE do not venture somebody else will; and after all,
     Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,
     if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.’
     The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, ‘Nonsense, nonsense!’
     What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?’ cried he.
      ‘Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you THERE.
       What say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.’
Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.
‘While Mary is adjusting her ideas,’ he continued, ‘let us return to Mr. Bingley.’
‘I am sick of Mr. Bingley,’ cried his wife.
‘I am sorry to hear THAT; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had known as much this morning
 I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape
 the acquaintance now.’

    <h2>The Time Machine  H. G. Wells, 1895 </h2>
    <img src="bookCover/13.png"  class="books">
<p>
    The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was expounding a recondite matter to us.
    His grey eyes shone and twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire burned brightly, and
     the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses.
     Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious
     after-dinner atmosphere when thought roams gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking
     the points with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it:) and his
      fecundity.
      ‘You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry,
       for instance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.’

    <h2>Treasure Island Robert Louis Stevenson , 1883 </h2>

<p>
    IT was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain,
     though not, as you will see, of his affairs. It was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard frosts and heavy gales; and it was
      plain from the first that my poor father was little likely to see the spring. He sank daily, and my mother and I had all the
       inn upon our hands, and were kept busy enough without paying much regard to our unpleasant guest.
       It was one January morning, very early—a pinching, frosty morning—the cove all grey with hoar-frost,
        the ripple lapping softly on the stones, the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to seaward.
        The captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old
         blue coat, his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. I remember his breath hanging like smoke
          in his wake as he strode off, and the last sound I heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort of indignation,
           as though his mind was still running upon Dr. Livesey.

    <h2>Crime and Punishment Fyodor Dostoevsky, 1866</h2>

<p>
    Raskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided society of every sort,
    more especially of late. But now all at once he felt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking place within
    him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy
     excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other world, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness
      of the surroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.
      The master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently came down some steps into the main room,
       his jaunty, tarred boots with red turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his person. He wore
        a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat, with no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil
         like an iron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was another boy somewhat younger who
          handed whatever was wanted. On the counter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and some fish,
           chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably close, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five
            minutes in such an atmosphere might well make a man drunk.

    <h2>The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde Robert Louis Stevenson, 1886</h2>
    <img src="bookCover/16.png"  class="books">
<p>
    MR. UTTERSON the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance, that was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in'
     discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary, and yet somehow lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to
      his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which spoke
       not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of his life. He was austere with
       himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors
       of one for twenty years. But he had an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure
        of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove.
        ‘I incline to, Cain’s heresy,’ he used to say. ‘I let my brother go to the devil in his quaintly: ‘own way.’
        In this character, it was frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives
         of down-going men. And to such as these, so long as they came about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his
          demeanour.

    <h2>Down and Out in Paris and London George Orwell, 1933</h2>

<p>
    There were eccentric characters in the hotel. The Paris slums are a gathering-place for eccentric people—people who have fallen
     into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent. Poverty frees them from ordinary standards of
     behaviour, just as money frees people from work. Some of the lodgers in our hotel lived lives that were curious beyond words.
     There were the Rougiers, for instance, an old, ragged, dwarfish couple who plied an extraordinary trade.
     They used to sell postcards on the Boulevard St Michel. The curious thing was that the postcards were sold in sealed packets as
     pornographic ones, but were actually photographs of chateaux on the Loire; the buyers did not discover this till too late, and of
      course never complained. The Rougiers earned about a hundred francs a week, and by strict economy managed to be always half starved
       and half drunk. The filth of their room was such that one could smell it on the floor below. According to Madame F., neither of the
       Rougiers had taken off their clothes for four years.

<p>
    Considering the difficulties which men have had to hold to a newly acquired state, some might wonder how, seeing that Alexander
    the Great became the master of Asia in a few years, and died whilst it was scarcely settled (whence it might appear reasonable
    that the whole empire would have rebelled), nevertheless his successors maintained themselves, and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose among themselves from their own ambitions.

    I answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to be governed in two different ways; either by a prince, with a
    body of servants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his favour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold
    that dignity by antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince. Such barons have states and their own subjects, who recognize
    them as lords and hold them in natural affection. Those states that are governed by a prince and his servants hold their prince in more
    consideration, because in all the country there is no one who is recognized as superior to him, and if they yield obedience to another
    they do it as to a minister and official, and they do not bear him any particular affection.

    The examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the King of France. The entire monarchy of the Turk is
    governed by one lord, the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into sanjaks, he sends there different administrators,
    and shifts and changes them as he chooses. But the King of France is …

    I flew around like mad to get ready, and before forty-eight hours I was crossing the Channel to show myself to my employers, and
    sign the contract. In a very few hours I arrived in a city that always makes me think of a whited sepulchre. Prejudice no doubt.
    I had no difficulty in finding the Company’s offices. It was the biggest thing in the town, and everybody I met was full of it.
    They were going to run an over-sea empire, and make no end of coin by trade.
    A narrow and deserted street in deep shadow, high houses, innumerable windows with venetian blinds, a dead silence,
     grass sprouting right and left, immense double doors standing ponderously ajar. I slipped through one of these cracks,
     went up a swept and ungarnished staircase, as arid as a desert, and opened the first door I came to. Two women, one fat and the other
     slim, sat on straw-bottomed chairs, knitting black wool. The slim one got up and walked straight at me— still knitting with downcast
     eyes—and only just as I began to think of getting out of her way, as you would for a somnambulist, stood still, and looked up. Her
     dress was as plain as an umbrella-cover, and she turned round without a word and preceded me into a …

<p>
    Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else,
    these pages must show. To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have been informed and believe)
    on a Friday, at twelve o’clock at night. It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry, simultaneously.
    In consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared by the nurse, and by some sage women in
    the neighbourhood who had taken a lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of our becoming
     personally acquainted, first, that I was destined to be unlucky in life; and secondly, that I was privileged to see ghosts
      and spirits; both these gifts inevitably attaching, as they believed, to all unlucky infants of either gender, born towards
       the small hours on a Friday night.
       I need say nothing here, on the first head, because nothing can show better than my history whether that prediction was verified or
        falsified by the result. On the second branch of the question, I will only remark, that unless I …
